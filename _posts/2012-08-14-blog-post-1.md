I just wanted to make this in order to keep all my ducks in a row about all the new vocabulary I am learning. Also in case someone needs a list themselves that is more layman terms (for all my machine learning friends). Hopefully the definitions do get more plentiful and comprehensive over time though 

Trans-regulatory elements
======
Proteins that encodes upstream regulators which regulates and modifies genes downstream and the distant genes. They attatch onto DNA sequences,proteins, and RNA in order to alter gene expression through binding. This promotes or blocks RNA polymerase from going to certain genes which inihibits or promotes gene expression.

Cis regulatory elements
======
Shorter portions of DNA that are able to regulate transcription of only neighboring genes (trans-regulatory can do downstream/distant ones). These regions are important because they can influence how a gene is expressed due to it being able to be bound by a transcription factor. A transcription being bound to it is important because it interacts with RNA polymerase to promote or block transcription.

Gene regulatory networks
------
While GRNs are bigger bigger in a sense a control center where all these interactions between trans-regulatory and cis regulatory elements come together in order to determine gene expression. Gene expression is important for
