I just wanted to make this in order to keep all my ducks in a row about all the new vocabulary I am learning. Also in case someone needs a list themselves that is more layman terms. Hopefully the definitions do get more comprehensive over time though :)

Trans-regulatory elements
======
Proteins that encodes upstream regulators which regulates and modifies genes downstream and the distant genes. They attatch onto DNA sequences,proteins, and RNA in order to alter gene expression through binding. This promotes or blocks RNA polymerase from going to certain genes which inihibits or promotes gene expression.

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
