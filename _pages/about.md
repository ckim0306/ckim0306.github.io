Hello Hello! Welcome to my website :>. I am currently a 1st year PhD student studying functional genomics and how changes to gene regulatory networks lead to phenotypic diversification. Currently I am working on the gene regulatory pathway of the accessory vs the main venom gland and how it leads to differential venom expression.

The Accessory Venom Gland Vs Main Venom Gland
======
My primary research focus currently is on if gene expression can help us understand the functional and physiological diffences in the accessory vs the main venom gland. We do this through figuring out the venom genes that are differentially expressed and the mechanisms that are able to explain this such as trans-regulatory factors (transcription factors) interacting with cis-regulatory factors (enhancers and promoters) within the two types of glands. 


Thank you to my gnomie

To my favorite who helped me make this website that is out of his paygrade or something thank you buddy. This is truly our monkey painting and I could not have done it without you!
