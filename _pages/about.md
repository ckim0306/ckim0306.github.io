Hello Hello! Welcome to my website :>. I am a currently 1st year PhD student studying functional genomics and how changes to gene regulatory networks lead to phenotypic diversification. Currently I am working on the gene regulatory pathway of the accessory vs the main venom gland and how it leads to differential venom expression.
