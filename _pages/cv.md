Work experience
======
* Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant
  * University of Texas, Arlington
    * January 2024-Present
      * Currently drafting a manuscript for exploring the accessory vs main venom gland 
      * Using R in order to process and illustrate my RNA-seq data
      * Assisted in DNA amplications for a paralel shistosome project in the lab 
      * Taught an ecology and human anatomy/physiology course with ~70 undergraduates in each session.

* Chemical Technician
  * Novoloop: Menlo Park
    * Febuary 2023-August 2023
      * Independently conducted experiments as part of larger efforts to streamline productivity among projects at Novoloop.
      * Collaborated with multiple project teams to research and develop core technologies for a pilot plant.
      * Primary responsibility resided in scaling up a plastic purifying process that turns polyethylene trash into a stronger
      thermoplastic polyurethane.
      * Analytically assessed the chemical purity of products synthesized from involved projects using HPLC.
      * Wrote up research reports to summarize my data and observations from experiments.

* Pilot Plant Technician II
  * Impossible Foods: Redwood City
    * August 2022-Febuary 2023
      * Primary responsibility was to scale purification of soy material using a variety of processing and extraction techniques such as: centrifugation, pasteurization, spray drying, vacuum belt filtration, vacuum oven and toasting, and filter pressing.
      * Worked with the EHS (safety) team to increase reported incidents so the issues could be addressed, create a physical and electronic SDS binder/file, to create a chemical incompatibility chart, and go on safety walks to identify hazards and discuss options for addressing them.
      * Ran solvent-based optimization experiments at the bench to optimize efforts of scaling up soy processing.
      * Collaborated using Gitlab to code in Python in order to improve the backend of the processing team’s Stream lit dashboard.
      * Fixed bugs using google app script to automate our batch records.
      * Merged and created new SOPs for two pilot plants
      * Organized three years of documentation for our pilot plan

* Staff Research Associate
  * UCSF Cardiovascular Lab: San 
    * March 2022-May 2022
    *  Performed microbiology and molecular biology experiments using E. Coli strains and a variety of plasmid vectors such
    as: PMDK.pACEMAM1, ED91, PEMSY4, PCDNA, TREK1cc-G1, and TRAKKcc-G1.
    * Conducted routine PCR, colony PCR, gel electrophoresis, bacterial inoculations, bacterial transformations, and a variety of nucleic acid purification and engineering techniques such as: PCR amplicon extraction and purifications, mini- and midi- plasmid DNA preparations, restriction digestions, and Gibson cloning.
    * Prepared and managed stock solutions for routine laboratory experiments, ensuring consistency and reliability in experimental procedures.
    * Maintained shipping logs and inventory of enzymes, cells, buffers, and general reagents the lab received.
    * Performed routine record keeping of my experiments in addition to supervising my post-doctorate’s experiments.

* Undergraduate Research Associate
  * University of California Los Angeles
    * December 2019-December 2021
      * Primary responsibility was to extract neurotoxin from specimens of newts (Taricha) in order to study the cause for
      neurotoxicity in an evolutionary context.
      * Performed an in-depth literature review on the evolution of altered gated sodium channels in garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) in response to the consumption of neurotixc newts.

* Graduate Research Intern
  * Claremont Graduate School Botany Program
    * August 2019
      * Fieldwork experience with collecting and analyzing Eriogonum fasciculatum.
      * Analyzed specimens using scanning electron microscopy,PCR,gel electrophoresis, and chromatography technique
      * Gathered,arranged,and collected lab data and notes to create representative information presented in a school wise
      conference
      * Validated incoming data from fellow classmates to check information accuracy and integrity while independently
      locating and correcting concerns on my own data

* Research Associate
  * El Camino Commmunity College
    * September 2017- August 2018
      * Examined phenotypic and behavior patterns of Tenebrio Molitor through 50 breeding cycles to determine the genetic ability of Tenebrio
      Molitor possess for environmental adaptation.
      * Wrote reports and helped classmates edit their research reports on their specimen.
